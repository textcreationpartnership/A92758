            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.9. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. Ask and it shall be given you, seek and yee shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.32. Your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
               <p>Live for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.16. Let all those that seek thee, rejoyce and bee glad in thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.10. Thou Lord hast not forsaken, never failed them that seek thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Prov.</hi> 1.28. They shall seek me early, but shal not find me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If not seek in time before the day of grace be past, or while the day of grace doth last, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.6. Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If not seek in Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. He that cometh to God must believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. They could not attain unto the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness because they sought it not by Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If not seek uprightly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.2. Blessed are they that seek him with their whole heart.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:168590:8"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.29. Thou shalt find the Lord thy God, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If not seek diligently, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. strive to enter in at the strait gate for many I say unto you shall seek to enter in and shall not be able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proverbs</hi> 2.4. If thou seekest as for silver, and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est for wisedom, as for hid treasures, then shalt thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If not seek in humility, humbling the soul by fasting and prayer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezra.</hi> 8.21. Then he proclaimed a fast, that we might afflict our selves before our God, to seek of him a right way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. If not seek in a right manner, as onely for fear of punishment, <hi>Hosea.</hi> 5.15. In their afflictions they will seek me early.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If not seek chiefly for grace and glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. For the Lord God is a Sun and a Shield, the Lord will give grace and glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For grace, as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.11. seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face continually.</p>
               <p>In obedience to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.8. When thou saidst seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee: Thy face Lord will I seek. For mercy, the sure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> pardon, reconciliation, hide not thy face from mee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. Seek righteousnesse, seek meekness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.45. I will walk at liberty for I seek thy precepts.</p>
               <p>For Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.14. Here we have no continuing City, but we seek one to come.</p>
               <p>(New Jerusalem) in a way of weldoing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7.
<pb facs="tcp:168590:9"/>who by patience in well doing, seek for glory and honour and immortality eternall life.</p>
               <p>A soul is encouraged to seek God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because Satan seeks whom he may devour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. your adversary the Devill as a roaring Lyon walketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seeking whom he may devour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because Christ came to seek and save that which was lost, <hi>Luke</hi> 19 10. Christ seeks the lost sheep, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because God is so gracious and mercifull, giving a heart to seek him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20. I was found of them that sought me not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> 4.23. The Father seeketh worshippers in Spirit and in truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Godly may seek and not find.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1. <hi>By</hi> night in my bed I sought him whom my soul loved, I sought him but I found him not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Saints have found in respect of grace, though sometimes at a loss in respect of comfort.</p>
               <p>God may hide himself for a while, to have us continue seeking, and to rejoyce in him the more when he is found of us, as the spouse did, <hi>Verse</hi> 2. I will rise therefore and seek him, and she saith <hi>verse</hi> 3. when I had passed a little from the watchmen, then I found him whom my soul lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I held him and would not let him go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.19. I said not in vain unto the house of Jacob seek ye me, I the Lord speak righteousness and declare righteous things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. If yee then bee risen with Christ seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>It is the property of such as are spiritually risen with Christ, to seek things above. Spirituall things are things above.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because they come down from above, they have
<pb facs="tcp:168590:9"/>their originall from God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, from him that is the fountain and Author of all goodness.</p>
               <p>Spirituall things are above nature (the light of nature) above the thoughts and desires of carnall and naturall men. Flesh and blood doth not reveal such things unto us. <hi>Nosce te ipsum de coelo descendit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They are called things above, because they tend to things above, <hi>Sursum corda,</hi> they draw a mans mind from earth to heaven, when a soul is possessed of spirituall things, it becometh heavenly minded; so that although a Christian must necessarily have some thoughts, and care for this world, yet the bent and frame of his heart stand another way, his thoughts run more towards God, Christ, graces of the spirit, the glorified Saints, and Angels and the joyes of heaven which are above, then after the creatures (which perish with the using) even as it is with a bird, it may bee it cometh down to the earth for food and sustenance, but it delights most to flye above. A Christian is like a wheel, whereof the least part is upon the earth, if it be down it is presently up again, and thus it is with them that are spirituall, they neglect earthly things to aspire to heaven and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Our conversation is in heaven, this is not to be understood that the Apostle was then glorified, but that his desires and endeavours went heaven ward, that his actions did tend thither, <hi>Romans</hi> 8.5. They that are after the spirit, savour the things of the spirit, <hi>Verse</hi> 6. to be earthly minded is death, but to be spiritually mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is life and peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Spirituall things are called things above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are fully injoyed in heaven above, there
<pb facs="tcp:168590:10"/>is the full fruition of them, glory is the consummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace, as grace is the first fruits and inchoation of glory.</p>

               <head>Seek Things above.</head>
               <p>True Seekers are</p>
               <p n="1">1 Sensible of their loss; our spirituall losses in <hi>Adam</hi> are great and grievous, God's favour and Image,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. All have sinned and come short of the Glory of God, we are without spirituall things till we seek them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seekers desire to find. Give me Christ or else I dye, it is no living for me without Christ, nor no dying for me without Christ; I have no fence for Hell, I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure torments invented by mortall men, How shall I bee able to grapple with the fulness of thy wrath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou hast threatned to punish sinne to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>Give me Christ the chiefest of ten thousand, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. (ten thousand persons, Angels, Worlds,) white and ruddy, white in his innocency and purity, ruddy in his satisfactory sufferings, both to make up a sinners righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <hi>Jere.</hi> 23.6. The Lord our Righteousness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.25. Surely shal one say in the Lord have I righteousness.</p>
               <p>Here is a pearl have it you shall.</p>
               <p>If to have it, you part with all.</p>
               <p>True Seekers set their affections on things above, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.2 So lesirous to find as to be willing to part with all for the pearl of great price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.45. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant man seeking goodly pearls.</p>
               <p>After worldly things do the Gentiles seek, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. I love them that love me, and those that
<pb facs="tcp:168590:10"/>seek me early shall find me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 35. Who so findeth me, findeth life, and shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain favour of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.4. One thing have I desired of the Lord, and that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lord, and to inquire in his Temple.</p>
               <p>Christ was found in the Temple, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.46.</p>

               <p>See Dr. <hi>Denison</hi> how far he went in dark times, in his book of both Sacraments, Baptisme, and the Lord's Supper, <hi>p.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Arise and be baptised and wash away thy sins: (he saith) the word baptising doth most properly signifie dipping over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and ears, and indeed this was the most usuall manner of baptising in the primitive Church: especially in hotter Countries, and after this manner was Christ himself bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 3.16. For there it is said of him, that when he was baptized he went out of the water; which doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that in his baptising hee went under the water, and thus all those that were baptized in rivers, they were not sprinkled but dipped.</p>
               <p>Further he saith, we do not in any sort condemn the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of dipping, but rather commend it, where it may bee without danger.</p>
